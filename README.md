# delay-causality-enforcement-using-Discrete-Hilbert-Transform-DHT-
This project is to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to simualte the behavior of caulality enforcement based on Discrete Hilbert Transform method in circuit simulation. 
* Use 'data+gen.py' to generate training data set using the library `github.com/TeledyneLeCroy/SignalIntegrity`.
* Use 'train.py' to train the ANN until the desired creteria is met.
* Use 'test.py' to test the ANN with the testing data set generated by `SignalIntegrity` on the fly and compare the result with the groudtruth generatd by traditional DHT method.
